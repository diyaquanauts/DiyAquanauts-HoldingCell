# DiyAquanauts-HoldingCell
Some place to hold DiyAquanauts scripts I'm on working until they're more ready for prime time...

For the moment, there's a working "capture.py" script that does Audio or Video, depending on if you call it with a "-a" or a "-v" argument.

There's also a set of (as yet unproven) instructions for installing the script(s) as a startup service using SystemD.

I'd like to add in some other sensors streaming, like depth, temperature, pH, etc -- plus there's always integrating the Serosa API.  It would be great to be able to interact with these things without having to SSH in everytime I wanted to change something...
