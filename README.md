# DiyAquanauts-HoldingCell
Some place to hold DiyAquanauts scripts I'm on working until they're more ready for prime time...

For the moment, there's a working "captureVideo.py" script and a mostly working "captureAudio.py" script.

Future plans include merging the two scripts together since they're both basically the same anyway, but that will take a little bit of planning and deliberation. 

Before that, I'd like to add in some other sensors streaming, like depth, temperature, pH, etc -- plus there's always integrating the Serosa API.  It would be great to be able to interact with these things without having to SSH in everytime I wanted to change something...
